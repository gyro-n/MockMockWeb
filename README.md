MockMockWeb
===========

MockMockWeb is a Node.js-based web application server that allows you to:

* instantly launch a website that sends an empty page (with status 200) to any request/URL
* edit any page on the spot
* edit the layout shared throughout your website
* use the website as if it was real
* get full control of the content and structure

MockMockWeb lets you build a mock (sometimes real) website in a request-driven interaction, very intuitive and easy to use (almost no learning curve).
